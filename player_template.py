"""
Simplified PokerBot – Player Template

You ONLY need to modify the `decide_action` function below.

The tournament engine (master.py) will:
  - Call this script once per round.
  - Send you a single JSON object on stdin describing the game state.
  - Expect a JSON object on stdout: {"action": "FOLD" or "CALL" or "RAISE"}

Your job:
  - Read the state.
  - Decide whether to FOLD / CALL / RAISE using a *quantitative* strategy.
  - Output the action as JSON.

You are free to:
  - Add helper functions.
  - Use probability / EV calculations.
  - Use opponent statistics for adaptive strategies.
  - As long as you keep the I/O format the same.

"""
Hand is always: your 2 hole cards + 1 community card = 3 cards.

We classify them into 6 categories (from weakest to strongest):

  0: HIGH CARD
  1: PAIR
  2: FLUSH
  3: STRAIGHT
  4: TRIPS  (Three of a kind)
  5: STRAIGHT FLUSH

And the *global ranking* is:

  STRAIGHT_FLUSH (5) > TRIPS (4) > STRAIGHT (3) > FLUSH (2) > PAIR (1) > HIGH_CARD (0)

This function only returns the category index 0..5,
not the tie-break details (you don't strictly need tie-breaks inside your bot).

# 3. Scoring summary (for your reference)
# ----------------------------------------
"""
IMPORTANT: these are the points awarded PER ROUND
depending on the actions and showdown result.

Notation:
  - "Showdown" means nobody folded: cards are compared.
  - result = which player wins the hand, not part of your code directly.

Fold scenarios (no showdown):
  P1: FOLD, P2: FOLD  ->  (0, 0)
  P1: FOLD, P2: CALL  ->  (-1, +2)
  P1: FOLD, P2: RAISE ->  (-1, +3)
  P1: CALL, P2: FOLD  ->  (+2, -1)
  P1: RAISE, P2: FOLD ->  (+3, -1)

Showdown scenarios (someone has better hand):
  Both CALL:
    - P1 wins: (+2, -2)
    - P2 wins: (-2, +2)

  P1 RAISE, P2 CALL:
    - P1 wins: (+3, -2)
    - P2 wins: (-3, +2)

  P1 CALL, P2 RAISE:
    - P1 wins: (+2, -3)
    - P2 wins: (-2, +3)

  P1 RAISE, P2 RAISE (High-Risk round):
    - P1 wins: (+3, -3)
    - P2 wins: (-3, +3)

Any showdown where hands are *exactly* identical:
  -> (0, 0)

Your bot does NOT see the opponent's current action,
but it CAN see opponent action frequencies over previous rounds
(via `opponent_stats`).
Use this to think in terms of EXPECTED VALUE (EV), not just raw hand strength.

    # Ideas:
    #   - Approximate win probability given (hole, table).
    #     For example, simulate random opponent hole cards and
    #     count how often you win at showdown.
    #
    #   - Combine win probability with scoring:
    #       EV(CALL)  ~  P_win * payoff_if_win(CALL vs typical opp action)
    #                 + P_lose * payoff_if_lose(...)
    #                 + P_tie * payoff_if_tie(...)
    #
    #       EV(RAISE) ~ similar, but include higher rewards (and penalties).
    #
    #   - Use opponent raise/call/fold rates to approximate how often
    #     each action profile (CALL/CALL, RAISE/CALL, etc.) happens.
    #
    #   - Then pick the action with highest estimated EV.
    #
    # For now, we provide a *simple heuristic* baseline that you can
    # improve or completely replace.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------

    # Simple heuristic strength bands (you should refine this)
    #  - Weak:  0 (High)
    #  - Medium: 1 (Pair), 2 (Flush)
    #  - Strong: 3 (Straight), 4 (Trips), 5 (Straight Flush)

    #  1) Very strong hands: often RAISE (you gain more points when you win).
    #  2) Medium hands: often CALL, occasionally RAISE if opponent is timid.
    #  3) Weak hands: FOLD more against aggressive opponents, CALL more
    #     against extremely passive ones.

    # Thresholds you can tune:
    HIGH_RAISE_RATE = 0.60  # "opponent is very aggressive"
    HIGH_FOLD_RATE = 0.50   # "opponent folds quite often"

    # Example policy:

    # Strong hands: attack
    if is_strong:
        # If opponent raises a lot, you are still happy to RAISE
        # because a successful showdown can give +3 or +3/-3.
